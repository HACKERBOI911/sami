<p>The most common degree a software engineer can get is a computer science degree however <br> since it is a science degree i will have to take some sort of math class and science class
The most famous colleges for computer science are: <br>Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Stanford University,Carnegie Mellon University,California Institute of Technology,Harvard University, and Columbia University
<br>These are very hard Schools to get into thats why i am taking cyber security at forest park it looks very good on college resumes.
